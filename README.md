# 3D Bouncing Ball Animation

## Overview

This project is a simple 3D bouncing ball animation built to demonstrate basic physics simulation and real-time rendering concepts. The animation models gravity, velocity, and ground collision to produce realistic bouncing motion. The project uses mathematical formulations to model 3d objects and movements

## Features

* 3D ball rendering
* Gravity-based motion
* Ground collision detection
* Realistic bounce behavior

## Technologies Used

* C++
* OpenGL / WebGL-style rendering pipeline (depending on implementation)

## How It Works

The ball’s position is updated each frame based on velocity and gravity. When the ball collides with the ground plane, its vertical velocity is inverted to simulate a bounce.

## Purpose

This project was created to practice and demonstrate fundamentals of computer graphics, animation, and physics-based motion. This projects was done as a final for our CSE 472 Computer graphics course at MSU

## Future Improvements

* Add squash and stretch animation
* Adjustable gravity and bounce strength
* Multiple objects or surfaces
